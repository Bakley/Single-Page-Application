# Single Page Application

This is a project demo that uses Vanilla JS to build a Single Page Application.

We’re going to build a simple currency application that will provide the following features:

1. Display the latest currency rates
2. Convert from one currency to another
3. Display past currency rates based on a specified date.

We’ll make use of the following free online REST APIs to implement these features:

1. [fixer.io]() API.
2. [Free Currency Converter]() API.

You’ll need to have the following setup in your environment:

1. [Node.js]()
2. [Git]() or [Git Bash]() for Window users.
